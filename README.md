# Numerical-Simulation-of-Quantum-Harmonic-and-Double-Well-Oscillators-in-3D (Date - 21 August 2025)
Goal: Solve the time-independent Schr√∂dinger equation numerically for 3D potentials, visualize eigenfunctions, energy levels, and compare 1D vs 3D behavior. Optional: Animate wavefunction evolution.  Tools: Python (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Mayavi or Plotly for 3D plots)
